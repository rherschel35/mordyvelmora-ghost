"""
Slash commands for talking to Maynard directly:

- /ask <question>   - ask Maynard something
- /watch <member>   - he picks someone as his next target for harmless mischief
- /experiment       - an entry from his old journals of (alleged) experiments
- /mood             - (admin) peek at his current mood

There is no /interact. Maynard doesn't talk to the other ghosts.
