"""
Passive haunting behavior: the ghost noticing things without being asked.

- A background loop that drops unprompted "whispers" into a random allowed
  channel every so often.
- Keyword-triggered reactions to certain words in ordinary messages.
- Remembering things members say, and occasionally resurfacing an old
  memory as if the ghost had been listening the whole time.
- Extra attention on anyone currently under a /haunt effect.
