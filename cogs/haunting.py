"""
Passive haunting behavior: the ghost noticing things without being asked.

- No unprompted chatter: the ghost only ever speaks in response to a real
  message from someone in the channel.
- Keyword-triggered reactions to certain words in ordinary messages.
- Remembering things members say, occasionally resurfacing an old memory,
  and periodically condensing recent activity into running notes about
  what is actually going on in the server.
- Extra attention on anyone currently under a /haunt effect.
- A capped, on-demand exchange with the other ghost bot (Finley Veyren),
  triggered by /interact - see cogs/commands.py for the command itself.
